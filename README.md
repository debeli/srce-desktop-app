cloning this repository, and every time `package.json` changes.

## Scripts

`npm start` will run the app as a desktop application.

`npm build` will create an `public/App.js` file, which is currently used by
`index.html` for loading JavaScript.

`npm dev` will track live changes for CSS and JS files
